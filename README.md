# bindbc-gnutls

This project provides both static and dynamic bindings to the [GnuTLS](https://gnutls.org/) library. They are `@nogc` and `nothrow` compatible and can be compiled for compatibility with `-betterC`.

But for static binding, please note that GnuTLS itself is licensed in [LGPLv2.1+](https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1) so these bindings must be used in a corresponding way.
